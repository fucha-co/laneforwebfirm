<p>Yeah they’re unreal. <strong>They help me with clothes.</strong> I shower there sometimes. <strong>The Cross has changed a lot.</strong> I keep to myself mostly. <strong>I’ve slept 12 straight Winters on the streets but I’m getting too old for this you know.</strong> Wayside get me referrals. <strong>I used to wear 32 jeans but now I wear 34’s.</strong> The Cross is the only place I know where you can gain weight sleeping rough. <strong>Cheap coffee too.</strong> I know Graham. I like him. <strong>Sometimes I just have to.</strong> They’re nice people in there. <strong>I haven’t been home for 3 days cause I can&rsquo;t get there without money.</strong> I lent a friend some money so now I have to stay here til I find him or some more. <strong>I don’t know how I’ll get home.</strong></p>

<p>Why Wayside? What a good question Laura; and in just two words too! It got me to thinking: so I went to the Cross on the weekend and asked it of some people who can answer it with a perspective I don&rsquo;t know. Their position in life is a perspective that most of us never know&hellip; because most of us just never ask. But it&rsquo;s so easy to ask and asking changes everything. A simple question with just two words can turn a never-known stranger-of-the-street into someone we know and someone with a story. And someone with a story is someone we can connect to because we&rsquo;re all human and we all have stories. Stories are powerful — the good ones reach in to touch our hearts and shape our minds. Every story starts by invitation and communication.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>While the answers above are not mine they are very real. And well-filtered. The reality of life is always as confronting and uncomfortable as it is beautiful and wonderful and the spectrum of answers I heard to the question &ldquo;Why Wayside?&rdquo; were no different. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know Wayside well — I know it a long-established, well-respected organisation providing support to those who truly need it. And I trust in all it takes to build and maintain such name in this modern world. I&rsquo;ve invested some extra time reading and watching what I can of Wayside as well as speaking directly to some who use your service. But this is not the first time I&rsquo;ve stopped and asked questions of strangers-of-the-street, nor helped beyond that. I&rsquo;ve done neither enough in my life but I have had, as Graham would say, a &ldquo;lived life&rdquo;; one that&rsquo;s never been motivated by money and one that&rsquo;s forever been motived by much more.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I believe Wayside and I are a great culture fit with well aligned values and that I can learn as much from you as I can offer you. Lane for Wayside was &ldquo;A Personal Application for a Personal Position&rdquo; from the second I saw your ad on SEEK, because I was wasn&rsquo;t looking for job&hellip; I was looking for much more.</p>
